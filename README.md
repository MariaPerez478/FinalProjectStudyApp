## App Evaluation

   - **Category:** Educational.
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is important to keep with easy and fast access to the tasks connected to the calendar. The app uses real-time action by the timer being on and the with the marking done or undone tasks the student can keep up with their work.
   - **Story:** The app would allow the student to plan their month and add important assigments or exam dates and make sure to keep with them using the calendar and marking them off when done. Additonally, they can use the timer for their study sessions.
   - **Market:** The market for this app are students who want to organize their tasks and have their routine plan out with a timer to study. 
   - **Habit:** Students would plan their day with the task app and the rest of the month if they wish to keep up with important assignments and tests and when they get home they can use the timer to keep track of how long their study sessions are going to be.
   - **Scope:** The basics of the app are not that challenging. However, the additionallt features would require more work since those would implement music and flashcards for better study sessions. The stripped-down version of the app would still be interesting to build since there is a lot of room for growth and potential. The basics of the app are elisted above and the aditional features can be added later on.
